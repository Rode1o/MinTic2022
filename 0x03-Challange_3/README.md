Summer has arrived, and brothers Carlos and Valeria are heading to the beach,
the trip lasts 2 hours from the city of Paleta to the beach of the city
Fuchsia, to have fun for a while while they were traveling they decided
Play a game. The game consisted of whoever guessed the first letter
from the name of the Pekkémons they saw on the road.
In order to play it, they put some rules, each one defined the letters
with which he wanted to participate, and seeing a pekkémon looked in his
pekkédex (it is a portable electronic encyclopedia where you can
automatically register the records of all the various species
Pekkémon seen during their trip as Carlos and Valeria do.), Yes
the name of the pekkémon began with the letter they had
chosen they scored a point, and then compared their
scores.
And they wrote down the following in a list, if Carlos had more points, he
wrote a "C", if Valeria had more points a "V" was scored,
but if the two had the same points, they scored a "P".
